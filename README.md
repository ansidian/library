# ðŸ“š Library Project

A basic library management system built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Built as part of The Odin Project's
curriculum, this assignment pushed me to apply JavaScript OOP principles and get a better handle on CSS.

## [Live Preview](https://ansidian.github.io/library/)

## Features

- Add new books with title, author, and page count
- Toggle read/unread status for books
- Remove books from the library
- Sort books by read, unread, or all
- Responsive grid layout for book display
- Modern modal form interface for adding new books

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

## Key Learning Outcomes

### CSS Skills

- Implement grid layout for book cards
- Create modal interfaces
- Design interactive toggle and hover states
- Practice flexbox for component alignment

### JavaScript Development

- Applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Utilized prototype functions for book management
- Implemented sorting functionality
- Handled form submissions and event prevention
- DOM manipulation and event handling

### HTML

- Structured semantic markup
- Form implementation
- Dialog/modal integration

## Implementation Challenges

The most significant challenge was implementing the sort functionality for books based on their read status. This
feature required:

- Managing state between the UI and data layer
- Handling dynamic updates to the book display
- Debugging edge cases in the sorting logic

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add data persistence
- [ ] Add local storage functionality
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add book categories/tags

## Learning Journey

This project was an excellent opportunity to:

1. Practice modern CSS layouts
2. Implement OOP concepts in JavaScript
3. Debug complex functionality
4. Handle user interactions effectively
5. Create responsive and intuitive UI
